  abstract  = {We propose a method of learning suitable convolutional representations for camera pose retrieval based on nearest neighbour matching and continuous metric learning-based feature descriptors. We introduce information from camera frusta overlaps between pairs of images to optimise our feature embedding network. Thus, the final camera pose descriptor differences represent camera pose changes. In addition, we build a pose regressor that is trained with a geometric loss to infer finer relative poses between a query and nearest neighbour images. Experiments show that our method is able to generalise in a meaningful way, and outperforms related methods across several experiments.},
